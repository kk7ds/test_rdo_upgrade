This tool tests upgrades of RDO packages (using packstack). It provides some
utility functions for doing various things, and can run named scenarios.
To test a Grizzly->Havana, do something like this on a clean EL6:

  # ./test_rdo_upgrade.sh grizzly2havana

Which should:

1. Install Grizzly
2. Create and verify a CirrOS guest
3. Shut everything down
4. Upgrade to Havana
5. Start everything up
6. Verify that the Grizzly guest is still okay
7. Create and verify a(nother) CirrOS guest

== NOTES ==

=== Scenarios ===

Additional scenarios can be placed in the scenarios/directory.

=== Config Tweaks ===

If you have a packstack-config.post file in the current directory, the
grizzly2havana scenario will try to make those changes to the answers file and
re-run packstack before starting the upgrade. This can be used to do a
multi-node install by putting the following in the post file:

  CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_HOSTS=192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2
