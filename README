This tool tests upgrades of RDO packages (using packstack). Currently, it just
tests Grizzly->Havana in the default configuration. On a clean EL6 system:

  # ./test_rdo_upgrade.sh

Should:

1. Install Grizzly
2. Create and verify a CirrOS guest
3. Shut everything down
4. Upgrade to Havana
5. Start everything up
6. Verify that the Grizzly guest is still okay
7. Create and verify a(nother) CirrOS guest

== NOTES ==

=== Config Tweaks ===

If you have a packstack-config.post file in the current directory, the script
will try to make those changes to the answers file and re-run packstack before
starting the upgrade. This can be used to do a multi-node install by putting
the following in the post file:

  CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_HOSTS=192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2
