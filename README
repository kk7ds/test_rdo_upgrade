This tool tests upgrades of RDO packages (using packstack). Currently, it just
tests Grizzly->Havana in the default configuration. On a clean EL6 system:

  # ./test_rdo_upgrade.sh

Should:

1. Install Grizzly
2. Create and verify a CirrOS guest
3. Shut everything down
4. Upgrade to Havana
5. Start everything up
6. Verify that the Grizzly guest is still okay
7. Create and verify a(nother) CirrOS guest
